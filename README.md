# nanoliteapp (Ri-Cycle)

Android Development
Nanoliteapp - Ri-Cycle is an application that implements image classification to classify waste into 6 types, namely plastic, glass, iron, cardboard, paper, and waste. Then the app will give you ideas for recycling waste by classification. To develop this application we use Android Studio with Kotlin programming language. The following are some of the things we implemented in this project:

1. Clean architecture
2. Dependency injection
3. Room
4. Firebase
5. Tensorflow lite.

Machine Learning - https://github.com/NanoLitee/Waste-Classification-and-Recycling-Ideas-Recommender
We use Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and transfer learning techniques using mobilenetv2 pre trained models to classify 6 kinds of inorganic waste and convert the model to tflite format to deploy it on android device.

Classification of 6 classes:
1. Cardboard
2. Glass
3. Metal
4. Plastic
5. Paper
6. Trash

And recommend recycling ideas based on the qualification results obtained
